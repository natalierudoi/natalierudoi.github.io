      I believe that every student of mine is unique and capable of rising to a high level of
      performance with self-motivation, discipline, and hard work.  I have had many years
      of experience teaching students of every age and level. From beginning to advanced
      players, I find creative ways to help each student reach his or her goals. Whether they
      have goals of becoming a professional musician or simply want to learn a new skill or
      hobby, I put the same amount of focus and attention into each individual.

      My method varies determined on the age and level of each  student. For beginning
      students, I combine Suzuki method training with my own traditional method. For the
      more advanced student, my method is based on the teaching principles of Ivan Galamian.
      My goal as a teacher is to establish a firm technical foundation that allows for freedom of
      artistic expression for each individual student. I believe that music is a language and an
      effective way of communicating the thoughts of one’s heart and mind to the listener.
      Each student has their own voice, and it is my goal to help them express that voice with
      confidence and joy. As the great cellist Pablo Casals once said, “Music is the divine way to
      tell beautiful, poetic things to the heart.” This is the center of my philosophy that I will instill
      in each of my students. Teaching has been and always will be a privilege for me as I help my
      students learn and grow in this beautiful form of self-expression and share with them my
      passion for music.
